This package contains four language definitions. Each next semantics builds
upon the previous. In the src directory five sources are found: one for each
definitions, and a file with QuickCheck properties. A source with a semantics
can be interpreted with ghci and contains several examples at the bottom.  The
four definitions are in order:

SimpleSemantics
  Launchbury's semantics: lamdbda calculus extended with constants,
  variables, let definitions and exceptions.

StackSemantics
  The Cost Centre Stack extension of Jarvis and Marlow.

TraceSemantics
  Our contribution: observing values and their Cost Centre Stack.

IntendedSemantics
  With correctness encoded in enclosed expressions.
